This document describes the detailed usage of `hkml`.  This doesn't cover all
details of `hkml` but only major features.  This document may not complete and
up to date sometimes.  Please don't hesitate at asking questions or help for
this document via GitHub issues.

Demo
====

![interactive list](images/hkml_interactive_list_demo.gif)
[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/632442.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/632442)

Note that the above demos are recorded on an old version of `hkml`.  Latest
version may have different features/interface.

Pre-requisites
==============

To use full features of hackermail, your system shoule be able to use below
commands.

- `git`: Required for reading mails from the mailing list.
- `git send-email`: Required for sending mails.

Commands
========

Hackermail can be executed using `hkml` command.  Using sub-command of it,
users can manipulate mails.  Users can show the list of sub-commands via the
`--help` option of `hkml`.  Similarly, each subcommand support `--help` option.

Initialization
==============

To properly work, hackermail requires 1) working directory, and 2) mailing
lists manifest.

Working Directory
-----------------

Working directory is a directory to save the fetched mails and hanckermail's
metadata.  You may think this as something similar to `.git` directory of git.

You can explicitly set the path to the directory using `HKML_DIR` environment
variable, or `--hkml_dir` option of each sub-command.  If the path is not
specified, hackermail assumes the directory is named as `.hkm` and placed under
current directory, the `hkml` executable file placed directory, or your home
directory and try to find it.  If it cannot find a proper working directory,
most of `hkml` sub-command will fail.

Manifest File
-------------

Manifest file is a file for information on mailing lists that you want to
communicate with using `hkml`.  It describes from where in the internet the
mails you want to read can be fetched, name of the mailing lists archived in
the site, and the site-relative path to the git repositories for each mailing
list in json format.  It's very similar to that of lore[1] except the fact that
hackermail manifest is containing the site information.  A sample manifest file
for the linux kernel mailing lists is located at `manifests/lore.js`, which has
generated by `scripts/update_lore_manifest.sh`.

You can explicitly set the path to the manifest file using `--manifest` option
of each sub-command.  If it is not specified, hackermail assumes it is placed
under the working directory in name of `manifest` and try to use it.

[1] https://www.kernel.org/lore.html

`init` sub-command
------------------

`init` sub-command of `hkml` does setting the working directory and manifest
file.  For example, if you call below command on this directory, it will create
the working directory as `.hkm` directory under the repo, and Linux kernel
mailing list as the manifest.  Hence, you will be able to use `hkml` for Linux
kernel mails from anywhere by using `hkml` file in this directory.

```
$ hkml init --manifest ./manifests/lore.json
```

Fetching Mails
==============

Users can download mails from specific mailing list that described on the
manifest file onto the local storage using `fetch` sub-command.  It receives
the names of the mailing lists to fetch.  By default, it receives latest
epoch's mails of given mailing lists.  For example, below command downloads
recent mails from linux-mm mailing list.

```
$ hkml fetch linux-mm
```

Note that fetching can be done with `list` sub-command, which will be described
below.  In some use cases, `fetch` sub-command may not frequently used.

Listing Mails
=============

Users can list mails of specific mailing list on the manifest file via `list`
sub-command.  By default, it lists the downloaded mails of the mailing list
that sent within last three days.  Users can let the command to do dowloading
of the mails together via `--fetch` option.  The sent time range of the mails
to list can be adjusted using `--since` and `--until` options.

In addition to the sent dates range, users can filter mails on the list by
author of the mail, keywords on subject or body, whether those are newly
started threads, via `--author`, `--subject_contains`, `--contains`, and
`--new` options, respectively.

The list shows all mails grouped by threads and sort the threads by sent date
of the latest mail of each thread.  Mails in each thread are sorted in the
reply order.  Users can show only first mail of each thread using `--collapse`
option.  It could be useful for mailing lists that people send huge amount of
mails every day.  Threads sorting key can also be customized using
`--sort_threads_by` option.  `--descend` option makes the sorting be done in
descendent order.  `--hot` option is a short cut for sorting threads by number
of comments in descendent way.

Below example lists mails that sent to [DAMON](https://damonitor.github.io/)
mailing list from 2024-02-15 to 2024-02-17.

```
$ hkml list damon --fetch --since 2024-02-15 --until 2024-02-17 --min_nr_mails 0

      Park, 24/02/16 11:40)
```

The output maybe intuitive to understand.  The first column of the each mail is
called index or identifier of the mail, and be used by other sub-commands that
will be described below.

The output is shown by `hkml`'s interactive viewer by default.  Refer to the
[section](#interactive-viewer) for details.

Supporting Mail Source Types
----------------------------

The sub-command support not only mailing lists on the manifest file, but more
sources.  All types of the supported sources of mails are as below.

- mailing lists.  Name of the mailing lists on the manifest can be passed.
- mbox files.  Paths to the mbox files of the mails can be passed.
- Special keyword, 'clipboard'.  If this keyword is passed as source of mails,
  the command assumes users have copied mbox-format string of the mails to list
  on the clipboard, read the clipboard, and show the mails.
- [`hkml tag`](#tagging)-added tags.  Users can add arbitrary tags to specific
  mails using `hkml tag` command, which explained below.  The tags can be used
  here.
- Nothing.  If no source of mails is given, `hkml list` shows the
  last-generated list output again.

`hkml list` tries to infer the type of given source with its best effort.  If
it cannot find the type of there are multiple possible types, the command will
fail with an error message.  To avoid such failures, users can provide the type
of the given source via `--source_type` option.

Public-inbox Search
-------------------

Note: this feature is experimental.

`hkml list` provides only simple filtering options.  In case of public-inbox
based mails fetching setup, users can use the sophisticated search query of
public-inbox using `--pisearch` option.  For example:

```
$ hkml list damon --pisearch "foo AND range damos filter"
# 2 mails, 2 threads, 0 new threads
# 2 patches, 0 series
# oldest: 2023-07-28 13:34:35-07:00
# newest: 2023-08-02 14:43:03-07:00

    2023/07/28 13:34)
```

Listing Entire Thread of a Given Mail
=====================================

On huge mailing list, reading all `hkml list` output takes time.  Also, because
`hkml list` lists mails that sent in user-specified time range (last three days
by default), some old mails of some threads may not listed.  Users can list all
mails of a specific threads containing a specific mail using `thread`
sub-command.  The mail of the thread can be specified by passing the mail
identifier of the mail to the sub-command.  The mail identifier should be that
of previously generated list, or the message-id.

For example, below command shows the thread of the third mail on the above
`hkml list` output.

```
$ hkml thread 3
# 6 mails, 1 threads, 1 new threads
# 6 patches, 1 series
# oldest: 2024-02-16 16:58:37-08:00
# newest: 2024-02-16 16:58:42-08:00

      (SeongJae Park, 24/02/16 16:58)
```

The command downloads whole mails of the thread from the internet and shows the
list.  If the system is not able to download the mails from the internet, only
the mails of the thread in the previously generated list is listed.  Note that
the mail indices are newly generated when mails are downloaded from the
internet.

The output is shown by `hkml`'s interactive viewer by default.  Refer to the
[section](#interactive-viewer) for details.

Reading Mails
=============

Users can open the content of the mail using `open` subcommand.  It receives
the identifier of the mail to read.  The identifier should be that of the last
generated `list` or `thread` output.

For example, below command shows the 18-th mail of the above list.

```
$ hkml open 3
Local-Date: 2024-02-16 16:58:40-08:00
Date: Fri, 16 Feb 2024 16:58:40 -0800
Subject: [PATCH 3/5] Docs/mm/damon: move DAMON operation sets list from the usage to the design document
Message-Id: <20240217005842.87348-4-sj@kernel.org>
From: SeongJae Park <sj@kernel.org>
To: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>
CC: SeongJae Park <sj@kernel.org>, Jonathan Corbet <corbet@lwn.net>, damon@lists.linux.dev, linux-mm@kvack.org, linux-doc@vger.kernel.org, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The list of DAMON operation sets and their explanation, which may better
to be on design document, is written on the usage document.  Move the
detail to design document and make the usage document only reference the
design document.

Signed-off-by: SeongJae Park <sj@kernel.org>
[...]
```

The output is shown by `hkml`'s interactive viewer by default.  Refer to the
[section](#interactive-viewer) for details.

`open` command supports not only mails from `list` or `thread` output, but also
normal text files.  Since the command shows the content with `hkml`'s
interactive viewer, which allows easy browsing of commits and public-inbox mail
links, this can be useful for reading some files such as patches or `git`
outputs.

Tagging
=======

Some classification of mails, e.g., important, unread, to-read-next, etc, can
be helpful for managing flooding mails.  Users can add, remove, or list tags
for mails using 'hkml tag'.  The command receives a sub-command for the three
different actions.

`hkml list` supports tags as source of the mails to list up.  Users can
therefore use `hkml list` to list mails of a specific tag.  Below example lists
mails of a tag `tag_damon`.

```
$ hkml list tag_damon
[...]
[0] Re: [PATCH 1/2] mm/damon/sysfs: Implement recording feature (cuiyangpei, 24/02/05 19:26)
[1] [PATCH] mm/damon/sysfs: handle 'state' file inputs for every sampling interval if possible
    (SeongJae Park, 24/02/05 18:51)
```

`hkml tag add`
--------------

Add tags to a specific mail.  The mail could be specified with the index of the
mail from the last-generated list or thread output.  Tags can be any arbitrary
string.  Below example adds three tags namely `tag_example`, `damon_patch`, and
`not_yet_merged` to the fifth mail of the last-generated list output.

```
$ hkml tag add 5 tag_example damon_patch not_yet_merged
```

`hkml tag list`
---------------

Users can show generated tags and how many mails of the tag exsits, using `hkml
tag list` command like below:

```
$ hkml tag list
tag_damon: 2 mails
tag_example: 1 mails
damon_patch: 1 mails
not_yet_merged: 1 mails
```

Users can show the list of mails for specific tags using `hkml list` by
providing the tag name as the source of mails.

`hkml tag remove`
-----------------

Users can remove tags from a specific mail using `hkml tag remove` command.
The mail to remove the tags from can be specified by the index of the mail from
the last-generated list or thread output.  Below example removes tag
`tag_damon` from the 0-th mail on the list and confirm it has removed using
`hkml tag list`.

```
$ hkml tag remove 0 tag_damon
$ hkml tag list
tag_damon: 1 mails
tag_example: 1 mails
damon_patch: 1 mails
not_yet_merged: 1 mails
```

Replying
========

Users can reply to specific mail on the last generated list, using `reply`
sub-command.  Similar to `thread` and `open`, it receives the identifier of the
mail to reply for, on the last generated `list` or `thread` output.

The command formats reply mail for the given mail and open VIM for the user's
interactive writing of the content.  Once the user finishes writing it and
close the editor, the command will show the content of the written reply mail
and ask it is ok to send the mail.  If the user answers the mail is correct and
ok to send, `reply` sub-command will send it.

For example,

```
$ hkml reply 3
[...] # hkml reply open VIM.  Below is an example output after closing VIM.

Will send above mail.  Okay? [y/N] n
```

Note that `hkml` send mail using `git send-email`.  Hence `git send-email`
should be configured correctly on the user's system.

Drafts
------

Regardless of users answer for the sending mail confirmation question, the
command further asks if the user wants to tag and save the written content as
`drafts`.  Like other drafts management, it is for a case that the user wants
to continue writing the mail later.

Hackermail tags and saves it as a draft by converting the written content to a
normal mail, and add a [tag](#tagging).  The name of the tag becomes `sent` or
`drafts`, depending on if the user approved posting the mail.  Hence users can
manage the drafts as usual tagged mails.  Refer to [Tagging](#tagging) section
for the detail.  The user can continue writing and sending the drafts using
[`write`](#writing-new-mails) command.

Forwarding
==========

Users can forward a specific mail on the last generated list, using 'forward'
sub-command.  Similar to `thread` and `open`, it receives the identifier of the
mail to forward, on the last generated `list` or `thread` output.  Users can
specify subject, recipients, Cc list, etc via command line.  Then `forward`
sub-command formats the basic mail, and let the user additionally make more
edits interactively and finally send it, in a way pretty similar to that of
`reply`.  Again, `git send-email` setup is required.

Writing New Mails
=================

Users can write new mail in a way similar to `reply` sub-command, using `write`
sub-command.  Users can specify subject, recipients, Cc list, etc via command
line.  Then `write` sub-command formats the basic mail, and let the user
additionally make more edits interactively and finally send it, in a way pretty
similar to that of `reply`.  Again, `git send-email` setup is required.

Users can write a mail using another mail as the original draft, using
`--draft` option.  The option receives a mail identifier from the previously
generated `list` or `thread` output.  Then, it format the content of the mail
as same to the specified mail, and allow user continue writing and sending it.

For example,

```
$ hkml reply 3
[...] # hkml reply open VIM.  Below is an example output after closing VIM.

Will send above mail.  Okay? [y/N] n
Tag as drafts? [Y/n] y
$ hkml tag list
[...]
drafts: 5 mails
$ hkml list drafts
[...]
$ hkml write --draft 0
[...] # hkml write open VIM.  Below is an example output after closing VIM.
Will send above mail.  Okay? [y/N] n
Tag as drafts? [Y/n] y
```

Synchronizing
=============

Users may use `hkml` on multiple devices or need to change their devices.  In
such cases, users can backup and restore some `hkml` settings and outputs via
remote storage using `sync` command.  Currently supported data includes

- manifest (created via `hkml init`),
- monitoring request (created via `hkml monitor`), and
- mails tagging information (created via `hkml tag`).

The command backs up and synchronizes the data using remote `git` repository.
Users therefore need to first create a `git` repository that accespts pushing
commits from the `hkml`-running machine.  The backup repo could be on the local
storage, a private server, or public git hosting services like `Gitlab` or
`GitHub`.  Then, the user could do the synchronization by running `hkml sync`.
For the first time of synchronization, user should provide the valid `git` url
for the backup repo to `hkml sync` via `--remote` option.

Below example shows how the mails tagging information can be synchronized
between two different machines using a GitHub repo.

```
$ # from the first machine
$ ssh machine_1
machine_1:~$ hkml tag list
to_read_later: 3 mails
to_review_later: 3 mails
to_test_later: 4 mails
machine_1:~$ hkml sync --remote git@github.com:$USER/hkml_backup_repo.git
$
$ # move to the second machine
$ ssh machine_2
machine_2:~$ hkml tag list
machine_2:~$
machine_2:~$ hkml sync --remote git@github.com:$USER/hkml_backup_repo.git
[...]
machine_2:~$ hkml tag list
to_read_later: 3 mails
to_review_later: 3 mails
to_test_later: 4 mails
```

Interactive Viewer
==================

![interactive list](images/hkml_interactive_list_demo.gif)

(Note that the above gif is recorded on an old version of `hkml`.  Latest
version may have different features/interface.)

Outputs of `list`, `thread`, and `open` are shown by `hkml`'s interactive
viewer by default.  The viewer maintains focus on a line of the content.  Users
can move the focus and make the focused-line's context-based actions using
short cut keys.  The actions include moving focus, open/forwarding a mail,
replying to a mail, managing tags of a mail, opening selection-based menu, etc.

Default Key Bindings
---------------------

Pressing '?' key shows available key bindings of current screen.  The available
key bindings and context-based menu items depend on the content of the screen
and focused line.

Regardless of the type, below keys are supported.

`j` and `k` key move focus down and up.

Pressing `m` key opens context-based menu that shows items that can be
selected.

`/` key starts keyword highlighting.

`q` key quits current screen.

Mails List Screen
-----------------

If the content of the screen is mails list (`hkml list` or `hkml thread`
output), actions for mail of the focused line becomes available.

Pressing `o` or `<Enter>` key opens the focused mail's content.  The content is
shown with a text screen viewer [type](#text-screen).

Pressing `t` lists the complete thread of the focused mail.  The list is shown
with mails list screen [type](#mails-list-screen).

Pressing `r` starts writing a reply to the focused mail.

Pressing `f` starts forwarding the focused mail.

Pressing `m` opens a selection-based menu.  From the menu, users can do abovely
explained actions.  In addition to that, the menu allows writing a mail using
the focused one as a draft, and managing tags of the mail.

Text Screen
-----------

If the screen is showing a general text (`hkml open` output or mail content
opened from `hkml list` output), the screen is call text screen type.

From this type, no additional key binding is supported.  However, the menu (`m`
key) on this screen shows some items that mails list screen doesn't show.

It shows no menu if the focused line is not having any git commit id or
public-inbox mail link.

If the line contains git commit ids, the men shows items for doing `git show`
or `git log` of the commit ids and showing the output.  The command output is
shown as general text.

If the line contains public-inbox mail links, the context-based menu ('`m`'
key) shows selections for opening the mail or listing the thread of the mail.
The text screen and mails list screen are used for opening the mail and listing
the thread options, respectively.

Note that `hkml open` allows opening normal text files.  Hence the comit ids
and public-inbox links based feature can help browsing of commit history and
related discussions.

Exporting Mails
===============

Users can export specific mails on the last `hkml list`-generated list to a
`mbox` file, using `export` sub-command.  It receives the path to the file that
will save the exported mail.  The file name should have `.mbox` suffix.  Users
can specify which mails from the list need to be exported via `--range` option
of the sub-command.

For example, below exports the first to fourth mails from above example mails
list to `foo.mbox` file, and then lists the exported mails in it again.

```
$ hkml export --range 0 4 foo.mbox
$ hkml list foo.mbox --since 2024-02-15 --until 2024-02-17

      document (SeongJae Park, 24/02/16 16:58)
```

Users could also import the mbox file on their other mbox-supporting mail
client.

Patches Management
==================

For mails of patches, `hkml patch` command is supported.  Using the comamnd,
users can check the patches and/or apply the patches on top of their local
source tree.  For the two purpose, it provides sub-command, `check` and
`apply`.

The two subcommands receives the identifier of the patch mail.  If it is given
with an index of a mail on last-generated list or thread, and if the index is
not for the real patch mail but a cover letter mail of the patch series, the
command fetches all patches of the thread and applies the action to those.

In the cover letter mail provided use case, the command will add the message in
cover letter into the first patch, like Andrew Morton usually
[does](https://git.kernel.org/sj/c/78f2f60377ee4).  Users can turn off the
behavior using `--dont_add_cv` option.

The command automatically adds 'Link:' and the user's 'Signed-off-by:' tags to
the patches.  It also checks if others provided 'Tested-by:', 'Reviewed-by:',
or 'Acked-by:' tags via reply, reports the finding to the user, and add the
tags to the patches before applying the actions if the user asks to do.

Checking Patches
----------------

`hkml patch check` receives the identifier of the mail of the patches and a
patch checker program to use for checking the patches.  The checker program
should be executable and receive the patch file as a positional argument.  If
there is `./scripts/checkpatch.pl`, it is used as the checker program by
default.  Then, this command fetches the patches and run the checker program.

For example, below runs Linux' `checkpatch.pl` for a patch series.

```
$ hkml list damon
[...]

```

Applying Patches
----------------

`hkml patch apply` receives the identifier of the patch mail and apply the
patches to local source tree.  The command assumes current working directory is
the local source tree.  If not, the user can set the path to the tree via
`--repo` option.

For example, below applies the patche series that `hkml patch check` example
was used for.

```
$ hkml patch apply 28 --repo ../linux

Monitoring Mails
================

Users can monitor new mails to specific mailing lists using `hkml monitor`
command.  Using this, users can get periodic notification of summary or updates
on specific mail threads that the user is not already in the loop, without
subscribing to the mailing list.  It works with sub-sub commands, `add`,
`status`, `remove`, and `start`.

`hkml monitor add`
------------------

`add` command adds monitoring request.  Users can specify
- the mailing lists to monitor,
- How often the monitoring should be done,
- what mails should be filtered in/out from the new mails,
- how the monitored mails should be displayed, and
- how the monitoring result should be delivered to users via command line
  options.

The command line options for specifying what mails to filtered and how those
should be displayed are very similar to that of `list` command.

It provides the monitoring results via the termina with some execution logs by
default, but users can asks it to send the new findings via sending emails to
specific addresses, or writing to specific files.

For example, users ask `hkml` to monitor updates to the `DAMON Beer/Coffee/Tea
chat series`
[thread](https://lore.kernel.org/r/20220810225102.124459-1-sj@kernel.org) for
every hour, format notification text with lore links for found new mails, and
send the notification text to their personal email address, like below:

```
$ hkml monitor add damon \
    --subject_keywords "DAMON Beer/Coffee/Tea chat series" \
    --monitor_interval 3600 --lore --noti_mails $YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
    --name "DAMON chat series monitoring"
```

`hkml monitor remove`
---------------------

Remove added monitoring requests.  User can specify the request to remove using
the index of the request on the requests list that can be shown via `hkml
monitor status`, or the name of the request which the user can set with `hkml
monitor add` command.

`hkml monitor status`
---------------------

Show status of the monitoring, including list of currently added monitoring
requests.

`hkml monitor start`
--------------------

Start the requested monitoring.  Monitoring requests that added after
monitoring is started is not automatically added to the running instance.  You
should start a new instance for new requests.  To stop running instance, you
can simply Ctrl-C.

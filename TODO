- Keep applying dimming for threads that opened from a list
  - e.g., if hkml list --dim_old 2024-11-16 and open complete thread of a mail
    on the list, I'd want the thread also have same dim setup.
- Allow listing recently opened threads
- Give users ability to change color for (+), (-), (>) lines in text viewer
- Support custom list format, like 'damo report access --format_region'
  - Or, just remove the unnecessary mail index for non --stdout case?
- patch export: let it exported on specific path

  - We read mail, go back to list, com back to mail again.  Remember and
    restore the cursor position to where it was at last time, at least for
    recent ones.

  - Diff ending line (--) is identified as diff hunk part and red-colored,
    e.g., 20241211203951.764733-2-joshua.hahnjy@gmail.com
- Remember and restore --dim_old for cached list output

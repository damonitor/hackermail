- Cleanup code
- patch apply
  - Support b4 failure (internet unconnected?)
  - Add 'Link:' tag when b4 is unavailable
  - Make b4 behavior consistent (support per-single-patch applying)
- thread: Use http://lore.kernel.org/all/<Message-ID>/t.mbox.gz instead of b4
- Consider supporting lore.kernel.org search results by downloading it from
  Atom feed.
- Support draft-sending case better
  - If 'hkml write' was invoked with --draft and user really send it, ask if
    they want the drafts be removed.
- Avoid pisearch's mbox download
  - Allow Mail object having no mbox; download mbox when 'get_field' is
    required.

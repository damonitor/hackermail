- Cleanup code
- Monitoring --pisearch updates
- Monitoring tagged threads
- Implement complete TUI
  - Support every feature with TUI
- Deprecate TUI menu and related code
- Give selection to tag removing menu
- Update lore manifest automatically
- Implement monitoring output pushing to git repo
- Put dim_old selection as sub menu of display effects
- Maintain last-opened time for each list in separate file
  - Currently, the time records are in list output cache.  When the cache item
    is removed due to the space limit, entire time records are gone.
    Maintaining the information in a separate file and removing old open time
    records in finer granularity under space limit would be better.
- Keep applying dimming for threads that opened from a list
  - e.g., if hkml list --dim_old 2024-11-16 and open complete thread of a mail
    on the list, I'd want the thread also have same dim setup.

- Cleanup code
- Monitoring --pisearch updates
- Monitoring tagged threads
- Implement complete TUI
  - Support every feature with TUI
- Deprecate TUI menu and related code
- Give selection to tag removing menu
- Update lore manifest automatically
- Implement monitoring output pushing to git repo
- Keep applying dimming for threads that opened from a list
  - e.g., if hkml list --dim_old 2024-11-16 and open complete thread of a mail
    on the list, I'd want the thread also have same dim setup.
- Allow listing recently opened threads
- Give users ability to change color for (+), (-), (>) lines in text viewer
- Support custom list format, like 'damo report access --format_region'
  - Or, just remove the unnecessary mail index for non --stdout case?
- Let interactive mails selection and menu for slected mails
- Clone and fetch old epoch git for searching if needed
- Make hidden context menu easier to find
- Rate-limit lore traffic
- Ask 'hkml patch format' tagging patches as sent-patches or drafts-patches.
- Support commits <-> patches queue conversion
  - 'patch format --series' creates 'series' file together
     - 'series' file contains name of patches in order, and baseline commit
  - 'patch apply' should be able to receive the 'series' file and assemble tree back
- Support tagging patch series easier
- Let mails cache reading delay explainable
  - E.g., when cached list output is used and --dim_old is set, dim handler
    reads mail's sent date, and it makes delay if mail cache is big.  Same for
    first mail read.  This makes user experience bad.  Think about improvement.
- Let adding quick note on viewer
  - The notes should be automatically added on reply draft.
- Let easier browsing on long mail
  - Let lines folding?
- When applying patch, 'Signed-off-by:' of the user is added to the commit with
  a blank line.  Investigate and fix.
- Color the focused line on mails list?
- Periodic mails list refresh
  - May better to double confirm if this is what we really need, though.
    'hkml monitor' can be used for a similar purpose.
- Export mail menu: disable double confirm of erasing screen
- Let filtering for only original mail and keep the thread

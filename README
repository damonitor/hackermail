hackermail
==========

hackermail is a mail client for hackers who collaborate using mailing lists.
Using hackermail, you can read mails from specific mailing list archives and
write mails to others.

For now, hackermail supports only public-inbox[1] managed mailing list
archives.

Quick Start
===========

The first step should be:

    $ ./hkml -h


List mailis in linux-mm mailing list sent in last three days:

    $ ./hkml fetch --manifest ./manifests/lore.js
    $ ./hkml ls linux-mm --manifest ./manifests/lore.js

Read the content of 5th mail in the list:

    $ ./hkml ls linux-mm --manifest ./manifests/lore.js --range 5 1

Send a reply to the mail:

    $ ./hkml ls linux-mm --manifest ./manifests/lore.js --range 5 1 > orig.eml
    $ ./hkml format-reply orig.eml > reply.eml
    /* Now open reply.eml, write your reply on it */
    $ ./hkml send reply.eml


Configuration
=============


Manifest File
-------------

First, you need a manifest file.  The file should describe where you can fetch
the mails, name of mailing lists, and the relative path to the git repository
for each mailing list in json format.  A sample manifest file for the linux
kernel mailing list is provided by 'manifests/lore.js'.


Configuration Directory
-----------------------

Hackermail needs a directory to contain its metadata, as similar to git's .git
directory.  Hackermail assumes the directory is named as '.hkm' and placed
under current directory, the hkml executable file placed directory, or your
home directory.  You can also explicitly set the path using 'HKML_DIR'
environment variable or '--hkml_dir' command option.

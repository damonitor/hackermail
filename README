hackermail
==========

Fast and decentralized CLI mail client for mailing lists that dedicated for
hacking project discussions (e.g., Linux Kernel Mailing Lists).


Configuration
=============


Manifest File
-------------

First, you need a manifest file.  The file should describe where you can fetch
the mails, name of mailing lists, and the relative path to the git repository
for each mailing list in json format.  A sample manifest file for the linux
kernel mailing list is provided by 'manifests/lore.js'.


Configuration Directory
-----------------------

Hackermail needs a directory to contain its metadata, as similar to git
configurations.  Hackermail assumes the directory is named as '.hkm' and placed
in current directory, the hkml executable file placed directory, or your home
directory.  You can also explicitly set the path using 'HKML_DIR' environment
variable or '--hkml_dir' command option.

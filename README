hackermail
==========

hackermail is a mail client for hackers who collaborate using mailing lists.
Using hackermail, you can read mails from specific mailing list archives and
write mails to others.

For now, hackermail supports only public-inbox[1] managed mailing list
archives.  Linux Kernel Mailing Lists (LKML)[2] are good examples.

Quick Start
===========

List mailis in linux-mm mailing list which are sent within last three days:

    $ ./hkml fetch --manifest ./manifests/lore.js
    $ ./hkml ls linux-mm --manifest ./manifests/lore.js

Read the content of 5th mail in the list:

    $ ./hkml ls linux-mm --manifest ./manifests/lore.js --range 5 1

Send a reply to the mail:

    $ ./hkml ls linux-mm --manifest ./manifests/lore.js --range 5 1 > orig.eml
    $ ./hkml format_reply orig.eml > reply.eml
    /* write your reply on 'reply.eml' with your favorite text editor */
    $ ./hkml send reply.eml

Write a mail to the mailing list:

    $ ./hkml format_mail --cc linux-mm@kvack.org > mail.eml
    /* write your mail on 'mail.eml' with your favirote text editor */
    $ ./hkml send mail.eml

For more detail,

    $ ./hkml -h


Working Directory
=================

Hackermail needs a directory to save the fetched mails and its metadata.  You
may think this as something similar to .git directory of git.

You can explicitly set the path using 'HKML_DIR' environment variable or
'--hkml_dir' command option.  If the path is not specified, hackermail assumes
the directory is named as '.hkm' and placed under current directory, the hkml
executable file placed directory, or your home directory and try to find it.


Manifest File
=============

hackermail manifest file describes from where in the internet the mails you
want to read can be fetched, name of the mailing lists archived in the site,
and the site-relative path to the git repositories for each mailing list in
json format.  It's very similar to that of lore[1].  A sample manifest file for
the linux kernel mailing lists is located at 'manifests/lore.js'.

You can explicitly set the path using '--manifest' option of relevant
subcommands.  If it is not specified, hackermail assumes it is placed under the
working directory in name of 'manifest' and try to find it.
